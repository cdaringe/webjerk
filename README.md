# webjerk

browser automation pipeline & plugins

## description

webjerk is a simple stupid, <200 LOC pipeline runner.  just what we needed.  YAPR (yet another pipeline runner).

webjerk has a 3 phase lifecycle: `pre`, `main`, `post`.

webjerk accepts plugins to register with it, and it runs those plugins.

## what can it do thats cool?

sounds lame.  do can it do anything cool?  no. but its plugins can!

see [webjerky](packages/webjerky).
