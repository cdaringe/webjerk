# snapjerk

web application screenshot testing in docker.

snapjerk is a small script that wires together a few webjerk plugins.  it runs element-wise screenshot testing in real browsers in a docker container.

specifically, it:

- generates [screenshots](https://github.com/cdaringe/webjerk/tree/master/packages/webjerk-snaps) of elements
- compares captured shots from a reference set of shots with [webjerk-image-set-diff](https://github.com/cdaringe/webjerk/tree/master/packages/webjerk-image-set-diff)
  - if no reference images are found, the first generated set are designated as references
- creates a [visual, interactive report](https://github.com/cdaringe/webjerk/tree/master/packages/webjerk-image-set-diff-reporter) when differences detected

## usage

### cli

```bash
ðŸ›° $ snapjerk --help

  web application screenshot testing in docker

  Usage
  // cli only execution
  $ snapjerk -s /path/to/static-site-directory -d '[{ elem: "body", name: "body" }]' # json or js array

  // using a snapjerk.config.js
  $ snapjerk

  // use a custom config file
  $ snapjerk -c /path/to/snapjerk/config.js

  Options
  -s, --static <directory>
  -c, --config <filename>
  -d, --definitions <snap-definitions>
```

### library

[API documentation lives here](https://cdaringe.github.io/webjerk/snapjerk/index.html).

```js
var snapjerk = require('snapjerk')
var conf = { ... } // see API docs
snapjerk(conf).then(...) // `snaps/` will be a dir with the result of `webjerk-snaps` within!
```

### approving changes

changes come in three forms:

- new images
  - approve by setting `WEBJERK_ALLOW_NEW_IMAGES=1` in your env
- changed images
  - approve changes by setting `WEBJERK_APPROVE_CHANGES=1` in your env
- removed images
  - approve by simplying removing the images from your reference set
  - PRs to automate this would be great!

for more on the image diffing and approval processes, see (webjerk-image-set-diff)[https://github.com/cdaringe/webjerk/tree/master/packages/webjerk-image-set-diff].

# why?

great options out there for testing visual diffs in browsers are slim.  i've
drawn the conclusion that most people roll their own image snap and comparison
solutions, or, bring in large swaths of dependencies and configuration to make
it all work.

this project aims to sceenshot testing really easy.  by easy, i mean:

- minimal dependencies
- minimal configuration
- small API surface
- easy to debug & hack on
- host agnostic screenshots. different browsers on different boxes yield different visual rendering.  browsers in docker resolves that.

the nearest thing to this project is  (BackstopJS)[https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS].  it's great!  it's more comprehensive
than this package, but also brings with it more complexity.  give it a shot if
snapjerk doesn't work out for you.
